# my-hyprland-dotfiles
Simple configuration for Hyprland on Arch Linux.

This repository is essentially a copy of the [ML4W Dotfiles](https://github.com/mylinuxforwork/dotfiles) that I tailored to my preferences.

All credit goes to Stephan Raabe and the contributors of the original project, I'm just a guy who didn't want to do everything from scratch.
However, unlike the original project, this project only supports Arch Linux, which is the distro I use.

Many wallpapers were taken from [ElementaryOS' repository](https://github.com/elementary/wallpapers), so the credit is theirs.

I also have a [subpage on the ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/User:0xMrRobot), where I detail my personal setups for various devices.

## Installation Instructions
These dotfiles can be installed with the Dotfiles Installer, also created by the ML4W project (available on Flathub). Click on the badge below to install the app.

Copy the following URL into the app:

A setup script is provided for Arch Linux only. For other distros, you will need to install all dependencies manually.
