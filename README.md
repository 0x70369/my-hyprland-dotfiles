# my-hyprland-dotfiles
Simple configuration for Hyprland on Arch Linux.

This repository is essentially a copy of the [ML4W Dotfiles](https://github.com/mylinuxforwork/dotfiles) that I tailored to my preferences.

All credit goes to Stephan Raabe and the contributors of the original project, I'm just a guy who didn't want to do everything from scratch.
However, unlike the original project, this project only supports Arch Linux, which is the distro I use.

Many wallpapers were taken from [ElementaryOS' repository](https://github.com/elementary/wallpapers), so the credit is theirs.

I also have a [subpage on the ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/User:0xMrRobot), where I detail my personal setups for various devices.
